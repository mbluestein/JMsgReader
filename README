#  SHORT DESCRIPTION

This small piece of software loads all .msg and/or .eml files inside a path into memory and 
makes their content searchable.

###############################################################################
#
#  USAGE

To use the program, a path where .msg and/or .eml files are stored must be passed as a 
parameter.

This could be as follows:
>> C:\JMsgReader\JMsgReader.jar D:\test\

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Windows only!!!!11eleven (at least for now)
For more comfort, you can assign a file extension to the application.

This could be done as follows:
>> C:\JMsgReader\JMsgReader.jar -setassoc MyFileAssociation

This command will now create an entry in the registry, which ensures that after 
clicking on a file with the given extension, the application is started 
automatically.
Now you can create a file like "Search_For_E_Mails.MyFileAssociation" and after 
clicking the application will show up and begin reading all the .msg files.
